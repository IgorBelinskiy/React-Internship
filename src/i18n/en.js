    html: `HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create
    and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, 
    links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications. 
    HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesn’t have the ability to create dynamic functionality.
    Instead, it makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.`,
    css: `Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for 
    describing the presentation of a document written in a  markup language such as HTML. 
    CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,  alongside HTML and JavaScript.
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation  and content, including layout, 
    colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content   accessibility, 
    provide more flexibility and control in the specification   of presentation characteristics, 
    enable multiple web pages to share formatting by  specifying the relevant CSS in a separate.`,
    node: `Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment 
    that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. 
    Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools 
    and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web 
    page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. 
    Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying 
    web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different 
    languages for server-side and client-side scripts.`,
    npm: `npm (originally short for Node Package Manager)[4] is a package manager 
    for the JavaScript programming language.
    npm, Inc. is a subsidiary of GitHub (a subsidiary of Microsoft), that provides 
    hosting for software development and version control with the usage of Git.
    npm is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js.`,
    git: `Git (/ɡɪt/)[7] is software for tracking changes 
    in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively 
    developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, 
    and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).`
